### Calculus Review and Notation

### Calculus Notation

### Taylor/Power Series

Since Taylor series appear frequently in the analysis of algorithms, this part of calculus is presented in its own section. The
starting point for the development of Taylor series is to consider the representation of an elementary function as a polynomial of
(possibly) inifinite degree.

### Matrix Notation and Matrix Algebra

### Differential Equation Notation

### Code Blocks

Github allows users to include code blocks in a variety of programming languages. Code blocks will appear as follow. When you
encounter a code block, you will be able to cut an paste code into text files. This will allow you to get code running easily.
A lot of the Exercises in this repository will require that you modify example codes which will require getting the example
codes to work correctly.

    subroutine smaceps(seps, ipow)
       .... ! code goes here....
    return
    end
