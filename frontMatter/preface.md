## Preface for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

The content in this repository is a work in progress at Utah State University (USU). There will be (are) several contributors to
this work. First, the students who have this (and other) course(s) have taught the author more and better computing tricks and 
should be given credit for these contributions. This is due to the fact that students tend to keep up on new and better 
computational toys than one aging professor
([There is a joke in there somewhere!](http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html)).
The author has learned and forgotten enumerable coding languages and computational tricks over a number decades. It is expected 
that other instructors of Math 4610 at USU will embrace this material. The expectation is that this repository will evolve into 
a set of freely available materials that students can use during the course and after completing the course for as long as this 
repository is maintained and/or Github continues to be so darned easy to use.

The initial version of this repository was created and maintained by [Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe). The author
has over 35 years of experience writing code for simulation of black oil reservoirs with an internship with Chevron Oil Field
Research Company (when it was called that) to Fishery Simulators written in Java for the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)
in Seattle, WA. Many of the projects in the repository have been studied and worked on by the author and a number of 
undergraduate and graduate students.

### Warantees and Disclosures

All, including anyone out on the internet are welcome to use this repository for learning and teaching topics commonly used in 
computational mathematics. There are loads of algorithms and other computational ideas that have and will be included in this 
repository. Some of the material is based on current hardware and software. As things change it is hoped that the material in 
the repository will keep up with newer methods and technologies.

If you find errors in the materials or typos, please send e-mail to the author at joe.koebbe@usu.edu. I will try to get to the
comments and errors as fast as I can take care of them. In other words, be a bit patient with corrections and modifications to 
the material. The material in this repository comes as is with the usual caveats for misuse and the like.

### MathJax and Notation

Mathematics in this repository is displayed using [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html) and regular html files
that contain bits of mathematics embedded in the html. For example, click on the following link to see what this might look like
in a web page: [MathJax Test](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/frontMatter/mathjaxTest.html).

### Graphics Formatting in the Text

Also, graphics displayed in the text are in GIF image files/format. A test case for the following image

<img src="https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/images/test.gif" alt="Test.gif not found" height="120" width="120">

is available at this link:

<a href="https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/images/test.gif" target ="_blank"> test.gif </a>

Note that you should be able to look at the .md file for this preface. The html/img tags and such can be copied directly from 
the file, [preface.md](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/frontMatter/preface.md). Note that the inclusion should work for any
graphics format (e.g, JPEG and BMP)
