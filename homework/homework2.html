    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 2 Problems
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ol type="1">
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that can be used to compute the absolute error
      $$ e_{abs} = | x - y |$$
      and relative error
      $$ e_{rel} = {{| x - y |}\over{x}}$$
      between a machine precision number, $x$, and an "exact" value, $y$. The output should be a single number of type double.
      Note that you should be considering the efficiency of the routines you write. So, do not use branching statements to
      write one routine to implement these types of algorithms in a single routine. Conditional statements should be avoided in
      terms of efficiency. Add the two routines to the software manual you are building throughout the semester and add the
      routines to your shared libraries.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: In this problem, you will investigate problems that occur due to finite precision of arithmetic. In the text,
      one standard approximation for derivatives involves the definition
      $$f'(x)\ dx = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\ {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}$$
      The approximation
      $$f'(x)\ dx \approx {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}$$
      is used in many application. For example, in the numerical solution of differential equations, the approximation above is
      used quite often. Write code that implements this approximation for various values of the paramter $h$. Use the routine
      you create, along with the code for the relative and absolute error, to investigate this approximation as $h$ tends to
      zero. Graph the results starting with $h=1$ and then dividing $h$ by two until the approximation fails to get better.
      Hint: Use any function you want from calculus. In fact, it would be best to try a couple of different functions. Add a
      summary of your work in your software manual as an example of the importance of absolute and relative errors in machine
      precision computations.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Sometimes a formula can be modified to mitigate issues related to machine precision computations.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Above, an approximation of the derivative. For $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ use the derivative approximation using to examine
          machine precision errors as $h$ tends to zero. Then use the conjugate of the numerator to rewrite the derivative formula
          using the following steps:
          <ol type="i">
            <li> multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate, </li>
            <li> simplify the expression, and </li>
            <li> analyze the errors using the new form of the derivative. </li>
          </ol>
          Compare the result with the direct use of the derivative formula.
        </li>
        <li> In this problem, approximate the derivative of $f(x)=sin(x)$ at $x_0=0$ using the difference
          $$\int\ f(x)\ dx \approx {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}$$
          and use a Taylor series expansion in place of the evaluation of the sine function. Recall that $sin(0)=0$. Rewrite
          the expression and make sure the derivative is accurately approximated as $h$ is taken closer to zero. What is the
          computational difference between the initial expression and the rewritten expression?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: For this problem, you will need to write a routine (or possibly more than one routine) that searches for a
      root of a given function using function iteration. Recall from your reading, you will need to provide an iteration
      function in each case. Apply functional iteration to each of the problems given below:
      <ol type="a">
        <li> $f(x)=x^2-3$ </li>
        <li> $f(x)=sin(\pi\ x)$ </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Implement the Bisection Method and test the method on the functions in the previous problem. Also, include
      an entry in your software manual with the results from the tests on the given function.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the previous exercise with code written to implement Newton's method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the previous exercise with code written to implement the secant method approximation of Newton's
      method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the previous exercise with code written to implement a hybrid method using bisection to guarantee
      the roots are bracketed and Newton's method for faster convergence once the interval has been narrowed. Make sure that
      the bisection method reduces the interval size by one order of magnitude ($10^{-1}$) when the method is necessary. Then
      try one step of Newton's method to see if the interval has been reduced enough.

    <li> Problem: Perform an online search for references to bracketing of roots of functions of a single real variable. Look
      for applications an explanations of how to bracket roots of nonlinear functions. Make sure that you cite at least three
      sources. You can cite web sites and/or web pages that discuss bracketing.
