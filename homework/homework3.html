    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 3 Problems
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Due: Monday, September 24, 2018
  </h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write routines that will compute and return the $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_\infty$ norms (lengths) of a given
      vector of arbitrary length. The routines should use as input, a vector and the length of the input vector and output
      a double value that is the length of the vector. Add the three routines to your software library. Add an entry in your
      software manual for each of the routines. Make sure that you include simple examples illustrating the usage of the
      functions/methods you have corrected.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that will compute the absolute and relative errors in the approximation of an "exact" vector
      and a vector used to approximate the exact vector. The routines should take as input two vectors, $x$ and $y$, and the
      length of the two vectors. The output should be a single double value that represents the error. Note that there are six
      total routines that need to be developed. There are three measures of error for both the absolute error and three for
      the relative error. The three routines should compute the errors in the $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_\infty$ norms as defined in
      the previous problem. As usual, add entries to your software manual with simple examples.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write separate routines for each of the following vector operations
      <ol type="a">
        <li> vector addition </li>
        <li> vector subtraction </li>
        <li> multiplying a scalar into a vector </li>
        <li> the inner product of two vectors of the same length </li>
        <li> the cross product of two vectors of the same length </li>
      </ol>
      Add entries to your software manual to cover these routines. As in all homework problems, include simple examples of how
      your code works.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write separate routines to compute the Frobenius, $l_1$, and $l_\infty$ norms of a matrix. Add entries to
      your software manual for these routines.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write separate routines for each of the following matrix operations. 
      <ol type="a">
        <li> matrix addition </li>
        <li> matrix subtraction </li>
        <li> the transpose a matrix </li>
        <li> trace of a matrix </li>
        <li> multiplying a scalar into a matrix </li>
        <li> multiplication of a matrix into a vector </li>
        <li> multiplication of two matrices </li>
      </ol>
      Add entries to your software manual for each of the routines you write.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines for the following additional matrix operations. 
      <ol type="a">
        <li> the outer product of two matrices </li>
        <li> the Kronecker product of two matrices </li>
        <li> determinant of a matrix </li>
      </ol>
      Add entries to your software manual for each of the routines you write.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that take advantage of parallel/concurrent computing to perform the following matrix
      operations.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> the product of a matrix and vector </li>
        <li> the product of two matrices </li>
      </ol>
    You do not need to add an entry to the software manual in this case. However, you need to give examples to verify your
    code works.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Write routines that implement the following vector operations.
      <ol type="a">
        <li> the outer product of two matrices, </li>
        <li> the inner product or dot product of two vectors, and </li>
        <li> the cross product of two vector. </li>
      </ol>
    <li> Problem: In a standard linear algebra course the process of changing bases is presented. For this problem, define
      an algorithm for determining an othogonal basis from a general basis in two dimensions. This means taking a pair of
      vectors, ${\bf v_1}$ and ${\bf v_2}$ and determining a pair of unit vectors that form an orthogonal pair of vectors,
      ${\bf u_1}$ and ${\bf u_2}$. Include an entry in your software manual with some simple examples.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Internet Search 1
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge....
