Computers are essential tools in science and engineering as well as in
entertainment in video streaming and gaming. Over time, the capabilities of
computers have grown due to computer engineering advances. However, the
resources will always be limited to finite storage and memory capacities. 

With all of these advancements, one might think that issues related to numerical
precision would be taken care of. However, this is not the case. There are a
couple of sites on the internet that document catastrophic failures of real
systems that can be atrributed to errors in numerical values due to finite
precision of arithmetic. The sites are:

       2. https://www5.in.tum.de/persons/huckle/bugse.html

\end{verbatim}
Each link associates some failure or loss of large sums of money due to the
inaccuracy of computed results. Examples like the Arian 5 rocket that self
destructed after launch due to register overflow that indicated the rocket was
off course. The rocket was actually on course with all systems functioning.

Scientists and engineers use continuos models that are defined for all real
numbers including irrational numbers. Irrational numbers cannot be represented
with a finite amount of information. These numbers can only be approximated on
computers.

{\bf Standardizing Number Representation:}
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in \noindent
If we represent a real number, \(x\), by an approximate number, \(fl(x)\), then
the difference between the two numbers is
\[
  E = \left\vert
         x - fl(x)
      \right\vert
\]
We will see a more precise definition of error in the next topic when we cover
absolute and relative errors.

In this section we will focus on the limitations of number representation on
computers. As mentioned above, the capabilities of computers have advanced
rapidly. Over the years computer
archetecture has increased resolution by using more bits to account for smaller
and larger numbers. Starting with 8-bit, 16-bit, and then onto 32-bit and 64-bit
numbers, the resolution has gotten better, but will never be able to represent
an infinite number of digits needed to store irrational numbers.

Even a number like \(1/3\) must be truncated after a finite number of digits due
to the way computers store numbers using bits. Data is stored in a binary format
on all computers. So, the number \(1/3\) becomes
\[
  {1\over 3} = 0.10101010101010\ldots
\]
The representation repeats, but it is necessary to use an infinite number of
digits to exactly represent the number.

As an example, consider a 64 bit representation of a number. The 64 bits are
split into three chunks. The bits are used to represent the mantissa or
