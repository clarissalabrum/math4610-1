<h1> Math 4610 Fundamentals of Numerical Analysis Tasksheet 3 </h1>

<hr>

The problems for the Tasksheet 03 are included below. The deadline for turning
in your work on these problems will be posted on the repository. In addition,
you will turn in your work through the math4610 repository. A directory will be
constructed that will be used as a place to store your work.

<h2> Tasks </h2>

<hr>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Task 1: </b> Computationally verify that the central difference
      approximation for the second derivative approximation defined in Task
      Sheet 2, Task 5 is actually second order accurate. Using values of
      \(h\neq 0\), compute the approximation and the difference between the
      exact value and the approximation. Print out the data in columns like
      those presented in the notes for the first order approximation of the
      the first derivative.
    </li>

<hr>

    <li>
      <b> Task 2:</b> Produce a log-log plot of the error from the data in Task
      1. Discuss how the results show that the approximation is second order
      accurate over a range of value where \(h>0\). Also, determine when the
      approximation begins to fail due to finite precision in the number
      representation and/or finite precision of arithmetic. You will need to
      write a code that produces the plot. If needed, you can use the Python
      code in the notes. 
    </li>

<hr>

    <li>
      <b> Task 3: </b> Write routines that will produce the machine epsilon as
      discussed in class. Write two separate routines, one for the single
      precision setting on your computer and one for double precision. Compile
      and test each of of these routines separately. This means writing a
      main() program in separate files. 
    </li>

<hr>

    <li>
      <b> Task 4: </b> In this task you will be asked to begin a software manual
      for the various routines that you will be creating over the semester.
      The software manual will span the entire semester and should include a
      lot of your work. The following steps should help organize your work.

      <ul>

        <li>
            Within your terminal, create folders to include the software pages
            in the math4610 repository. Create a folder using something like
            <pre>

                     koebbe% mkdir software_manual

            </pre>
            Then create a file that will contain a table of contents for pages
            that are created for individual routines. Maybe something like
            <pre>

                     koebbe% cd software_manual
                     koebbe% vim software_manual_toc.md

            </pre>
            When you edit the file, create a unique link for each new software
            page added. There is a
                 <a href="../../../softwareManual/softwareManualTemplate.md">
                 Markdown template </a>  that provides an example of what is
                 <a href="../audio/tps_cover.wav">expected</a>. You can make a
                 copy of the templacte file in the folder created above. Then
                 edit the file to create a page for your code.
 
                 For example, create a page for the single precison
                 version of the code from Task 3.
                 <pre>

                  koebbe% cp softwareManual/softwareManualTemplate.md smaceps.md

                 </pre>
                 or
                 <pre>

                   koebbe% cp softwareManual/softwareManualTemplate.md smaceps.html
                   koebbe% vim smaceps.html

                 </pre>
                 depending on whether or not you want to use MathJax for math
                 notation.
        </li>

        <li>
          Build the links to the individual pages in the table of contents
          file by adding an entry to the table for each routine.
        </li>

        <li>
            Build the link from your README.md repository file at the top level.
            That is, add a line like
            <pre>

  [Software Manual Table of Contents:](./software_manual/software_manual_toc.md)

            </pre>
        </li>

      </ul>

      There are a lot of ways to do this. The steps above  should provide the
      structure you need. You might consider building a template for the pages
      from the page you can download and make copies from the template.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b> Task 5: </b> This task will walk you through the development of a
      shared library for your routines from the two routines written and tested
      in this tasksheet. Suppose that the two routines are named, smaceps() and
      dmaceps().

      <ul>

        <li>
          Create two files that contain only the code for the routines for
          the machine epsilon computation. No main() method is needed.
        </li>

        <li> Compile each of the files using an object name. For example
             <pre>

               koebbe% gcc -c smaceps.c
               koebbe% gcc -c dmaceps.c

             </pre>
             or
             <pre>

               koebbe% gcc -c *.c

             </pre>
             This will produce two files:
             <pre>

               koebbe% ls *.o
               dmaceps.o  smaceps.o
               koebbe%

             </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
          Created a shared library,
          <pre>

            koebbe% ar rcv mylib.a dmaceps.o smaceps.o

          </pre>
          This is the archive command in Unix and the \lq\lq\ cvf\rq\rq\
          informs the archive command to create, be verbose, and use the
          file name specified for the library. The output will be a file
          of the form
          <pre>

            koebbe% ls mylib.a
            mylib.a
                
          </pre>
        </li>

        <li> \item Make the library a random access library.
          <pre>

            koebbe% ranlib mylib.a
                
          </pre>
          This last step allows a link/load command to access the routines
          in any order. You can check the result using the following
          command.
          <pre>

            koebbe% ar tv mylib.a
                
          </pre>
          This gives a table of contents for the archive/shared library.
        </li>

      </ul>
    </li>

<hr>

    <li>
        <b> Task 6: </b> Search the internet for discussions of shared
        libraries. Write a brief summary of what you find including the pros and
        cons of shared libraries. Your write up should be a brief paragraph (3
        or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites
        you cite.
    </li>

  </ul>
